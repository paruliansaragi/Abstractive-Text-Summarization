# Abstractive Text Summarization Research Meta-Analysis

Here I will cover research in this field that inspire the core of my work. 

The task of document summarization is generally split into extractive vs abstractive summarization. 
The former involves extracting salient sentences from a corpus. The latter involves the former but with 
a generative (rewriting a summary) aspect which is much more akin to human summarization. 

The advances in sequence-to-sequence models has enabled the success of this task.
